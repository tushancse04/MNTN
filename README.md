### MNTN
MNTN is a Neural Tensor Network(NTN) based neuro-symbolic model that exploits symmetries in MLNs and can predict ground atoms in MLNs.

### Package Requirements
Python 3.5

Genism 3.x

Tensorflow 2.x

### Training and Testing
We have tested on multiple datasets. Preprocessed datasets are available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qf80kmYc6CdhVP8FUWb3bSDcha1kKoSt?usp=sharing and store  the dataset to the project directory.

To train and test the model, run Test_DS.py providing the dataset name to get the performance, for example:

python Test_DS.py citesheer
